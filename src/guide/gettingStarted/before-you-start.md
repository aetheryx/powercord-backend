# Before you start...

Plugin creation isn't for the light of heart, its very tricky to understand but hey? I bet you dont even fricking read this and skip a poop ton of 
pages because you are rushing, if you actually spent the time to read this, you will understand this guide successfully.

This guide is temporary, will probably get deleted and modified over time so enjoy this small list of sad people who
actually spent their time to make a boring little guide that barely anyone will use...

Add your github profile if you helped contribute to the guide, no matter how small of an edit, write it up...
